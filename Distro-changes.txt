Yukiko: Added a function, ValidateStringInteger(str), to
		/scripts/include/string.inc to validate AND strip leading zeros from
		a string representation of an integer. It will validate decimal and
		hexadecimal integers that are string representations. Just send it
		the string. It returns the string or an error if the string does not
		contain valid integer digits.
Yukiko:	Fixed a bug in the spawnsystem spawner.src GM command by wrapping the
		call to GFExtractData() in the new ValidateStringInteger() function.
		When adding regions the gump presented with zeros (0) in the coordinates'
		text entry boxes. This introduced a bug if the user did not backspace
		over the zero prior to entering coordinate values because a leading zero,
		when sent to the CInt() Core function denotes that the string to be
		converted to an integer is octal (base eight) notation. The resulting
		coordinates were not being saved correctly. I did the same thing 
		to the the GFExtractData for max_amt.
Yukiko:	Fixed a bug in :spawnsystem:spawnUtil.inc in the SS_ItemValidLocation() function.
		The if(SS_IsInHouse( spawn_coords )) was changed to if(!SS_IsInHouse( spawn_coords )).
		This was preventing items and reagents from spawning outside of static houses.
Yukiko	Fixed another bug in :spawnsystem:spawnUtil.inc. Added the following to the
		SS_NPCValidLocation() function:
		if(!SS_IsInHouse( spawn_coords ))
			return 0;
		endif
		to prevent NPCs from spawning in static houses.
Yukiko:	Made a minor change to :housing:housing.inc in the FindHouseForLocation()
		function. It now explicitly returns a zero if the location is not in a house.
Yukiko:	Changed the gump for displaying region coordinates in
		:spawnsystem:commands/gm/spawner.src by expanding the coordinates text
		entry area to allow for entering 4 digits even with the leading 0.
		I also adjusted the headings X1, Y1, X2, and Y2 above the text entry boxes.
Yukiko:	Added a parameter, lmt to limit the length of text that can be entered in
		the element, to the comment header definition to the GFTextEntry function
		in :gumps:gumps.inc. This parameter was added to the function a while back
		by ThisIsMe but was not added to the function definition in the comment header.
